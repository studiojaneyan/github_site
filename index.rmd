The epistemology units in biostatistics include three aspects. 

The first is threshold inbetween spaces. This includes classification method to objects and subjects, which is modelling probabilities to exposure and outcome in catelogs or logical catelogs. 

The second is truth by most likely principle. This includes inverse probability weighting, fusion in censored or uncensored data, and misclassification bias.

The third is construction of system by numbers and letters. This abstraction is a linkage to other fields where numbers and letters are also applied with meanings.
